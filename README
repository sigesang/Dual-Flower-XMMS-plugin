Dual Flower - plugin for XMMS
by Joakim Elofsson 1999

REQUIERMENTS:
	working XMMS  (X, gtk+, pthreads... etc)
	<http://www.xmms.org>

BUILD:
	included binary was build on an linux-ix86-glibc2.2.3 system
	
	to build, do:
	make

	if you want you may change OPT in Makefile etc.

INSTALL:
	try  make install  as root (or  su -c 'make install')

	will install plugin in xmms plugindirs and themes in
	themedir (in xmms datadir)
	
	(if you have no root access, it's probably possible installing this
	in your ~/.xmms dir, if so.. you must edit XMMS_DATADIR &
	INSTALL-DIR in Makefile, and recompile)

USE:
	activate it in XMMS Vis-plugin-config
        ...
 
  skins
   are 277x145 sized xpm, the first 275 columns is the background
   and the toppixel of the last one sets the graphcolor

 included skins (made by me)
  bg_xmms.xpm   - the one in the .so, made to look like default xmms-skin

  bg_blueheart.xpm - by loneowl at ritalin.shout.net

possibel TODOs (not planned)
  * better follow XMMS-mainwindow
  * more advanced skins
  * more modes (?)
